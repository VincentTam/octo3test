Goal
---

1. To satisfy the dependency requirements for my Octopress blog
2. Easy maintenance after future upgraded

Guide
---

The central idea of [Chris Bednarski's article][guide] about correct
Ruby setup on Linux matches that of [Go Rails' setup guide][guide2].
The former is written a few years before the launch of Windows 10
though.

Result
---

I installed Ruby Linux bash on Windows so that it's possible to have
*multiple* versions of Ruby for running different apps.
