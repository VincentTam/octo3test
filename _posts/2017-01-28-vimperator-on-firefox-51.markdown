Background

Firefox automatically upgraded to v.51 this morning.

Problem
---

Many important functionalities in the Firefox plugin [Vimperator],
which enables efficient web browsing with [Vim] keystrokes, are now
*broken* since the upgrade.

This will be fixed in a year or two, so it's *not* worth the effort to
look into this [Vimperator compatibility issue][issue568]
