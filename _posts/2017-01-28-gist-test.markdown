Last night, Jekyll's Gist tag *didn't* work during preview.

{% gist abc1cbd2b2181ad69165 %}

This morning, I tried using `git bisect` to figure out the cause of
this problem.  It turns out that it *isn't* a problem of Octopress'
Gist tag.  It's actually a problem of my code highlighter and gist
cache.
