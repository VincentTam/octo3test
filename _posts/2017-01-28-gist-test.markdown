Last night, [Jekyll's Gist tag][jekyll_gist_tag] *didn't* work during
preview.

{% gist abc1cbd2b2181ad69165 title:"My VIMRC for GVIM on Win 7" range:136-146  mark:137,140-141 %}

This morning, I tried using `git bisect` to figure out the cause of this
problem.  It turns out that it *is* a problem of my installed version of
[Octopress' Gist tag][octopress_gist_tag] while handling Gists with
multiple files.
